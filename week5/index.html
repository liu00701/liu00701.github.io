            <p class="notes highlight">The sun rose gently over the quiet town, casting soft golden rays across the rooftops. Birds chirped cheerfully, welcoming a new day. The streets, still empty, would soon fill with life as people went about their routines. Children laughed as they ran to catch the bus, while shopkeepers prepared to open their doors.</p>
            <p class="notes">In the park, the breeze rustled the leaves of the tall trees, creating a peaceful atmosphere. Dogs chased after frisbees, and joggers moved along the path. As the morning unfolded, the town buzzed with activity, but there remained a calmness in the air. All was well.</p>
            <p class="highlight">As the sun climbed higher in the sky, the town came alive with the sounds of daily life. Cars honked, people chatted, and music played from open windows. The smell of fresh bread wafted from the bakery, mingling with the scent of blooming flowers. The town was a symphony of sights, sounds, and smells, a vibrant tapestry of life.</p>
