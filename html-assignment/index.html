            <p>My Chinese name is Shuang Liu and my English name is Sherman. I like travelling. I have been to many cities in China in the past two years. Compared with northern cities, I like southern cities, like NanNing, GuangZhou, because there are more green trees there. Also, the food there is great, like rice noodles, I can add different spices to it.</p>
            <p>Now, I am studying <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> in Ottawa. This is my 1<sup>st</sup> time in Canada and I like being here, because people here are friendly. They often say sorry to me. My professors are patient and enthusiastic. My classmates are nice too. I hope I can have a good memory here for the next two years.</p>
            <p>Here is a quote I like: </p>
            <blockquote>
            I believe that oppressive forces exist in the world, but we have enough <em><strong>freedom</strong></em> to fight against them. -<cite>M. Scott Peck</cite>
            </blockquote>
